**Question 1**    
Which of the following is a well know `Ridge` hyperparameter?

<opt text= "<code>alpha</code>"  correct="true">
 
Super!

<exercise id="4" title="Using Ridge">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

Using our well know basketball dataset, we are going to build a model using the `height` feature and assess if it can help predict a players `weight`.

Tasks:   
- Import the Ridge function. 
- Create a mape scorer from the map function that we provided. Make sure you specify in the scorer that lower number are better for MAPE. 
- Build a Ridge model called `ridge_bb`.
- Use `RandomizedSearchCV` to hyperparameter tune `alpha`. Fill the blanks so it uses `ridge_bb` as an estimator and the values from `param_dist`.
- Fit your grid search on the training data.
- What is the best value for `alpha`? Save it in an object named `best_alpha`.
- What is the best MAPE score? Save it in an object named `best_mape`.

<codeblock id="08_04">

- Are you importing the Ridge function?
- Are you making the mape scorer with `make_scorer(mape, greater_is_better=False)`?
