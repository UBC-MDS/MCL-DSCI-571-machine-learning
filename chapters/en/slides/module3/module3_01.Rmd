# Data Splitting

Notes: <br>

## Recap

### Training score versus generalization score 

- Given a model, in Machine Learning (ML), people usually talk about two kinds of scores (accuracies):

1. Score on the training data
   
<br>   
    
2. Score on the entire distribution of data



Notes: 

At the end of module 2, we discussed two kinds of scores (accuracies) in a model:

1. Score on the training data
    
2. Score on the entire distribution of data


But we do not have access to the entire distribution which is where our interests lie so what do we do? 



---

## We can approximate generalization accuracy by splitting our data!

<br>

Notes: 


We keep aside some randomly selected portion from the training data.

We `fit` (train) a model on the training portion only. 

We `score` (assess) the trained model on this set-aside data to get a sense of how well the model would be able to generalize.

We pretend that the kept aside data is representative of the real distribution (ùê∑) of data.

## Simple train and test split

<br>
<br>

<center><img src="/module3/train-test-split.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>


Notes: 


The data is shuffled before splitting. 

We then split up our data into 2 separate sections. 

The picture shows an 80%-20% split of a toy dataset with 10 examples. 

Usually, when we do machine learning we split the data before doing anything and put the test data in an imaginary chest lock.

Notes: 

We can do this very easily with a tool from Scikit Learn. 

It gives us the versatility to either pass `X` and `y` or a dataframe with both `X` and `y` in it. 

It uses useful arguments such as:

- `test_size`
- `train_size`
- `random_state`

---

```{python}
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
cities_df
```


Notes: Let's test it out in action with the Canadian and United States cities data that we saw in module 2.


---

```{python}
X = cities_df.drop(columns=["country"])
X
```

Notes: First we have our `X` dataframe. 

---

```{python}
y = cities_df["country"]
y
```


Notes: Followed by our `y`, target column.

---

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
```

```{python}
X_train.head(3)
```


Notes:

First we import `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. 

We split our data and separate our `X` and `y` variables into 4 separate objects that we name:

- `X_train`
- `X_test`
- `y_train`
- `y_test`


---

```{python}
X_test.head(3)
```

```{python}
y_train.head(3)
```
```{python}
y_test.head(3)
```

Notes: 

<br>

---

```{python}
shape_dict = {"Data portion": ["X", "y", "X_train", "y_train", "X_test", "y_test"],
    "Shape": [X.shape, y.shape,
              X_train.shape, y_train.shape,
              X_test.shape, y_test.shape]}

shape_df = pd.DataFrame(shape_dict)
shape_df
```


Notes: 

Let's take a look at the shape of each of these dataframes now. 

---

```{python}
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 123)

X_train, y_train = train_df.drop(columns=["country"]), train_df["country"]

X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns=["country"]), test_df["country"]

train_df.head()
```


Notes:
Sometimes we may want to keep the target in the train split for EDA or for visualization.

That's not a problem. 

We can do this by splitting our `cities_df` dataframe into a train and test dataframe as objects `train_df`, `test_df`, and then separate the features from the target after the fact. 

---

```{python}
chart_cities = alt.Chart(train_df).mark_circle(size=20, opacity=0.6).encode(
    alt.X('longitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-140, -40])),
    alt.Y('latitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[20, 60])),
    alt.Color('country:N', scale=alt.Scale(domain=['Canada', 'USA'],
                                           range=['red', 'blue'])))
chart_cities
```

```{python include =FALSE}
chart_cities.save(path + 'chart_cities.png')
```

<img src="/module3/chart_cities.png" alt="A caption" width="63%" />

Notes:  Now we can plot the data from the training data `train_df`, we can differentiate between the Canadian cities (red) and the United States cities (blue).

---

```{python}
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```


Notes: 

We can build our model and fit our data.

---

```{python include=FALSE}
model2 = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=77)
model2.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

```{python include=FALSE}
display_tree(X.columns, model2, "../../../../static/module3/module3_01_small")
```

<center><img src="/module3/module3_01_small.png"  width = "78%" alt="404 image" /></center>

---

```{python include=FALSE}
display_tree(X.columns, model, "../../../../static/module3/module3_01a")
```

<center><img src="/module3/module3_01a.png"  width = "78%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes:


---


```{python}
print("Train score: " + str(round(model.score(X_train, y_train), 2)))
print("Test score: " + str(round(model.score(X_test, y_test), 2)))
```

Notes:

Let's examine the train and test scores with the split now.

We can see our model does not do as well a job generalizing as we did before. 

Our training score is 1, however, our testing score is 0.71.

---

```{python echo=FALSE,  out.width = '105%'}
model.fit(X_train, y_train);
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1);
plt.title("Decision tree model on the training data");
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, model, ticks=True, ax=plt.gca())
plt.xlabel("longitude")
plt.ylabel("lattitude")
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2);
plt.title("Decision tree model on the test data")
plot_classifier(X_test, y_test, model, ticks=True, ax=plt.gca())
plt.xlabel("longitude")
plt.ylabel("lattitude")
```

Notes: 


The plot above shows the boundaries from the tree trained on training data and the test data.

### *test_size* and *train_size* arguments


```{python}
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 123)
```

```{python}
shape_dict2 = {"Data portion": ["cities_df", "train_df", "test_df"],
    "Shape": [cities_df.shape, train_df.shape,
              test_df.shape]}

shape_df2 = pd.DataFrame(shape_dict2)
shape_df2
```

Notes: 

Let's take a closer look at the arguments in the splitting tool. 

When we specify how we want to split the data, we can specify either `test_size` or `train_size`. 

See the documentation <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

There is no hard and fast rule on the split sizes should we use and it depends upon how much data is available to us 

Some common splits are 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 (training/test).

In the above example, we used an 80/20 split. 




---

### *random_state* argument


```{python}
train_df_rs5, test_df_rs5 = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 5)
```

```{python}
train_df_rs7, test_df_rs7 = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 7)
```

```{python}
train_df_rs5.head(3)
```

```{python}
train_df_rs7.head(3)
```



Notes: 

The data is shuffled before splitting which is a crucial step. 
The `random_state` argument controls this shuffling. 

In the example above we used `random_state=5` and `random_state=7` and we can see that they contain different observations.

Setting the random_state is useful when we want reproducible results.
