# Cross-validation

## Single split problems

Notes: 

We saw that it's necessary to split our data into multiple different sets/splits but is having a single train and validation split optimal? 

The problem with having a single train/validation split is that now we are using only a portion of our data for training and only a portion for validation. 

If our dataset is small we might end up with a tiny training and/or validation set.

We might also be unlucky with our splits such that they don't align well or don't well represent our test data.

---

## So what do we do? 


### ùëò-fold cross-validation

<center><img src="/module3/cross-validation.png"  width = "100%" alt="404 image" /></center>

Notes: 

We use something called ***cross-validation*** or ***ùëò-fold cross-validation*** as a solution to this problem.. 

Cross-validation helps us use all of our data for training/validation!

Cross-validation consists of splitting the data into k-folds ( ùëò>2 , often  ùëò=10 ).  In the picture below  ùëò=4 .

Each "fold" gets a turn at being the validation set.

Each fold gives a score and we usually average our ùëò results. 

It's better to notice the variation in the scores across folds.  

We can get a more "robust" score on unseen data.

The main disadvantage here is that this is slower, which is a problem for bigger datasets / more complex models.


---

## Cross-validation using scikit-learn


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
X = df.drop(columns=["country"])
y = df["country"]
```

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
```


Notes: 

let's bring in our Canadian/United States cities data and split it.



---


```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4)
cv_score = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
cv_score
```


Notes: 

First we import `cross_val_score` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

We create our decision tree model.

We use `cross_val_score()` and specify the model and the training features and target as arguments. We also specify `cv` which determines the cross-validation splitting strategy or how many "folds" there are.

Here we are saying there at 5 folds on the data. 

In each fold, it fits the model on the training portion and scores on the validation portion.

We can see the output is a list of validation scores in each fold.



---

```{python}
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10)
cv_scores
```

```{python}
cv_scores.mean()
```


Notes: 

We can change the number of folds too. Now, when we change it to 10, we get 10 different scores.

---

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
```

```{python}
scores = cross_validate(model, X, y, cv=10, return_train_score=True)
scores
```



Notes: 

`cross_val_score()` is the simpler scikit-learn function for cross-validation.

Let us access training and validation scores.  




---

```{python}
scores
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

Notes: 

`scores` is returned as a dictionary but it's much easier to understand if we convert it to a dataframe.

---

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores).mean()
```

```{python}
cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10).mean()
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores).std()
```

Notes: 

Using `cross_validate()` instead of `cross_val_score()` gives us more information. 

`cross_val_score()` was just returning that last column, but here we get the time spent and the training scores.

We can calculate the mean of each column on the 10 folds.

It's a bit unfortunate that they call it "test_score" in scikit-learn; for us this is a validation score.

We can see the mean from this is similar to the mean from `cross_val_score()`.

Normally we calculate the mean cross-validation score but sometimes it would be useful to look at the range and standar deviation of the folds.

### Our typical supervised learning set up is as follows: 

<br>

1. Given training data with `X` and `y`.
2. We split our data into `X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`.
3. Hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation on `X_train` and `y_train`. 
4. We assess the best model using  `X_test` and `y_test`.
5. The **test score** tells us how well our model generalizes.
6. If the **test score** is reasonable, we deploy the model.


Notes: 
We are given training data with features `X` and target `y`.

We split the data into train and test portions: `X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test`.

We carry out hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation on the train portion: `X_train` and `y_train`. 

We assess our best performing model on the test portion: `X_test` and `y_test`.  
What we care about is the **test score**, which tells us how well our model can be generalized.

If this test score is "reasonable" we deploy the model which will be used on new unseen examples.

How do we know whether this test score is reasonable? 

We will discuss this in the next section!
