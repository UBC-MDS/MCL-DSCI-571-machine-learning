# Decision Tree Regressor

Notes: <br>

---



```{python}
regression_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-regression.csv")
regression_df
```



Notes: 

We can also use the decision tree algorithm for regression problems. 

Instead of using gini (which we briefly mentioned this in previous slides), we can use <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#mathematical-formulation" target="_blank">some other criteria</a>  for splitting. 
(A common one is mean squared error (MSE) which we will discuss shortly)

`scikit-learn` supports regression using decision trees with `DecisionTreeRegressor()` and the `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigm that is similar to classification.

Just like when we talked about the baseline Dummy regressor, `.score()` for regression returns somethings called an <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html#sklearn.metrics.r2_score" target="_blank"> ùëÖ2  </a>.    

The maximum ùëÖ2  is 1 for perfect predictions. 
It can be negative which is very bad (worse than DummyRegressor). 

--- 

```{python}
X = regression_df.drop(["quiz2"], axis=1)
X.head()
```

```{python}
y = regression_df["quiz2"]
y.head()
```

Notes: 

**Decision Tree Regressor** is built using `DecisionTreeRegressor()` and a similar `.fit()` and `.predict()` paradigms as classification.

We split our data just like we did before into our feature table and our target. 



---

```{python results = 'hide'}
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
depth = 4
reg_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=depth)
reg_model.fit(X, y)
```


Notes: 

Instead of importing `DecisionTreeClassifier`, we import `DecisionTreeRegressor`.

We follow the same steps before and can even set hyperparameters as we did in classification. 

Here when we build our constructor, we are specifying a `max_depth` of 4.

```{python include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
import graphviz
dot_data = export_graphviz(model)
graphviz.Source(
    export_graphviz(
        model4,
        out_file=None,
        feature_names=X.columns,
        class_names=["red", "blue"],
        impurity=True,
    )   
).render("../../../../static/module2/module2_16a", format='png') 
```

```{python include=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
display_tree(X.columns, reg_model, "../../../../static/module2/module2_16a")
```

```{python}
reg_model.predict(X.loc[[0]])
```

```{python}
predicted_grades = reg_model.predict(X)
regression_df['predicted_quiz2'] = predicted_grades
print("R^2 score on the training data:" + str(round(reg_model.score(X,y), 3)))
```

```{python}
regression_df.head()
```



Notes: 

This time when we predict a single observation, instead of getting a prediction that is a category or class, we are getting a numerical value.

Here we see that the model predicts a grade of 90 for the first observation. 

Let's see how well this model does predicting the entire data.

Since the ùëÖ2  value is 1.0,  the model perfectly predicts the outcome of every observation.

This is quite different from what we were getting with a Dummy Classifier which had an ùëÖ2  value of 0.
