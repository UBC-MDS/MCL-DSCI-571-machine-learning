# Choosing K (n\_neighbors)

Notes: <br>

---

``` python
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
X = cities_df.drop(columns=["country"])
y = cities_df["country"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.1, random_state=123)
```

``` python
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train.to_numpy());
```

``` python
model.score(X_train,y_train)
```

```out
1.0
```

Notes:

In the last section, we saw we could build a `KNeighborsClassifier` in a
similar way to how we‚Äôve built other models.

The primary hyperparameter of the model is `n_neighbors` ( ùëò ) which
decides how many neighbours should vote during prediction?

What happens when we play around with `n_neighbors`?

Are we more likely to overfit with a low `n_neighbors` or a high
`n_neighbors`?

Let‚Äôs examine the effect of the hyperparameter on our cities data.

``` python
k = 1
knn1 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
scores = cross_validate(knn1, X_train, y_train, return_train_score = True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

```out
   fit_time  score_time  test_score  train_score
0  0.002236    0.003549    0.710526          1.0

4  0.002560    0.003156    0.837838          1.0
```

``` python

knn100 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
scores = cross_validate(knn100, X_train, y_train, return_train_score = True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

### How to choose `n_neighbors`?

``` python
results_dict = {"n_neighbors": list(), "mean_train_score": list(), "mean_cv_score": list()}

for k in range(1,50,5):
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    scores = cross_validate(knn, X_train, y_train, return_train_score = True)
    results_dict["n_neighbors"].append(k)
    results_dict["mean_cv_score"].append(np.mean(scores["test_score"]))
    results_dict["mean_train_score"].append(np.mean(scores["train_score"]))

results_df = pd.DataFrame(results_dict)
results_df
```

```out
   n_neighbors  mean_train_score  mean_cv_score
0            1          1.000000       0.755477
1            6          0.831135       0.792603
2           11          0.819152       0.802987
3           16          0.801863       0.782219
4           21          0.777934       0.766430
5           26          0.755364       0.723613
6           31          0.743391       0.707681
7           36          0.728777       0.707681
8           41          0.706128       0.681223
9           46          0.694155       0.660171
```

Notes:

`n_neighbors` is a hyperparameter.

We can use hyperparameter optimization to choose `n_neighbors`.

Notes:

Here we see that when `n_neighbors` is equal to 11, the cross-validation
score is the highest.

---

``` python
sorted_results_df = results_df.sort_values("mean_cv_score", ascending = False)
sorted_results_df
```

```out
   n_neighbors  mean_train_score  mean_cv_score
2           11          0.819152       0.802987
1            6          0.831135       0.792603
3           16          0.801863       0.782219
4           21          0.777934       0.766430
0            1          1.000000       0.755477
5           26          0.755364       0.723613
6           31          0.743391       0.707681
7           36          0.728777       0.707681
8           41          0.706128       0.681223
9           46          0.694155       0.660171
```

``` python
best_k = sorted_results_df.iloc[0,0]
best_k
```

```out
11
```

Notes:

We can confirm this when we sort the scores.

---

``` python
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=best_k)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train);
print("Test accuracy:", round(knn.score(X_test, y_test), 3))
```

```out
Test accuracy: 0.905
```

Notes:

Now when we build our model with `n_neighbors=11` we can hope that our
test accuracy will be optimized.

### Curse of dimensionality

<br>

  - ùëò -NN usually works well when the number of dimensions is small.

Notes:

This affects all learners but it‚Äôs especially bad for nearest-neighbour.

ùëò -NN usually works well when the number of dimensions is small but
things fall apart quickly as the number of dimensions goes up.

If there are many irrelevant attributes, ùëò -NN is hopelessly confused
because all of them contribute to finding similarity between examples.

With enough irrelevant attributes, the accidental similarity swamps out
meaningful similarity and ùëò -NN is no better than random guessing.

### Other useful arguments of `KNeighborsClassifier`

Notes:

There are many different arguments to use with `KNeighborsClassifier`,
one of them being `weights`.

`weights` allows us to assign a higher weight to the examples which are
closer to the query example.
