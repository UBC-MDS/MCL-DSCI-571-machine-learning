# Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with RBF kernel

Notes: <br>

---

```{python}
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
train_df.head()
X_train, y_train = train_df.drop(columns=['country']), train_df['country']
X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns=['country']), test_df['country']
```

```{python}
train_df.head()
```

Notes: 

Another popular similarity-based algorithm is Support Vector Machines (SVM).

SVMs use a different similarity metric which is called a "kernel" in SVM land. 

We are going to concentrate on the specific kernel called Radial Basis Functions (RBFs).

Let's bring back our trusty cities dataset again before introducing it. 


---


```{python}
cities_plot = alt.Chart(train_df).mark_circle(size=20, opacity=0.6).encode(
    alt.X('longitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-140, -40])),
    alt.Y('latitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[20, 60])),
    alt.Color('country:N', scale=alt.Scale(domain=['Canada', 'USA'],
                                           range=['red', 'blue'])))
cities_plot
```

```{python include =FALSE}
cities_plot.save(path + 'cities_plot.png')
```

```{python}
from sklearn.svm import SVC
```


```{python}
svm = SVC(gamma=0.01)
scores = cross_validate(svm, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```
```{python}
svm_cv_score = scores['test_score'].mean()
svm_cv_score
```


Notes: 

We must first import the necessary library and then we can get to model building in the same fashion as we did before.  

Here we are importing the `SVC` tool from the `sklearn.svm` library. 

For now, just ignore the gamma input argument in `SVC()` we will get to that soon. 


---

```{python}
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
X_train, y_train = train_df.drop(columns=['country']), train_df['country']
X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns=['country']), test_df['country']
```


```{python include=FALSE}
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn.fit(X_train, y_train);
scores = cross_validate(knn, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```


```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '100%'}
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.title("SVC")
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, svm, ax=plt.gca())
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("KNN with k = 5")
plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, knn, ax=plt.gca())
```


Notes: 

if we plot the decision boundaries of the SVM model and compare it to K-Nearest Neighbours we can see some similarities. 

You can think of SVM with RBF kernel as "smooth KNN". 

---

### SVMs

```{python}
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train);
scores = cross_validate(knn, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
pd.DataFrame(scores)
```

```{python}
knn_cv_score = scores['test_score'].mean().round(3)
knn_cv_score
```

```{python}
svm_cv_score.round(3)
```

Notes: 

Superficially, SVMs are more like weighted ùëò-NNs.

A test example is positive if on average it looks more like positive examples than negative examples. 

The primary difference between ùëò -NNs and SVMs is that 
  - Unlike ùëò -NNs, SVMs only remember the key examples (support vectors). So it's more efficient than ùëò -NN. 
  
If we compare the scores from the ùëò-NN model using `n_neighbors=5` and the scores from the SVM model we get similar results.

## SVM Regressor 


```{python}
from sklearn.svm import SVR
```



Notes:

It should come as no surprise that we can use SVM models for regression problems as well.

We need to make sure to import SVR from the SVM sklearn library.

### Hyperparameters of SVM are:

    - `gamma`
    - `C`
    


Notes: 

We are not going to go into detail about the meaning behind these parameters but you should be able to explain how they affect training and testing scores (The fundamental trade-off). 

If you wish to learn more on these you can reference <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_rbf_parameters.html" target="_blank">Scikit-learn`'s explanation of RBF SVM parameters</a>.

### Relation of gamma and the fundamental trade-off

`gamma` controls the complexity of a model, just like other hyperparameters we've seen.

- As  gamma  ‚Üë, complexity  ‚Üë
- As  gamma  ‚Üì, complexity ‚Üì

<br>
<br>
<br>

```{python  echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 12,  out.width = '100%'}
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4))
for i in range(4):
    plt.subplot(1, 4, i + 1)
    gamma = 10.0 ** (i - 3)
    rbf_svm = SVC(gamma=gamma)
    rbf_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
    plt.title("gamma = %s" % gamma);
    plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, rbf_svm, ax=plt.gca(), show_data=False)
```


Notes: 

---

### Relation of C and the fundamental trade-off

C also affects the fundamental tradeoff.

- As  C  ‚Üë, complexity  ‚Üë
- As  C  ‚Üì, complexity ‚Üì

<br>
<br>
<br>

```{python  echo=FALSE, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 16,  out.width = '100%'}
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 4))
for i in range(4):
    plt.subplot(1, 4, i + 1)
    C = 10.0 ** (i - 1)
    rbf_svm = SVC(C=C, gamma=0.01)
    rbf_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
    plt.title("C = %s" % C);
    plot_classifier(X_train, y_train, rbf_svm, ax=plt.gca(), show_data=False)
    
```


Notes: 

Obtaining opimal validation scores require a hyperparameter search between both of these to balance the fundamental tradeoff.

We will learn how to search over multiple hyperparameters at a time in the next module.
