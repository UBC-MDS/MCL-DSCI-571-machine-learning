# Types of machine learning

Notes: <br>

---

Typical learning problems:  

- **Supervised learning (this course)** (<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2368132?hl=en" target="_blank">Gmail spam filtering</a>)
    - Training a model from input data and its corresponding labels to predict new examples.     
- Unsupervised learning (<a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a>)
    - Training a model to find patterns in a dataset, typically an unlabeled dataset.
- Reinforcement learning (<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a>)
    - A family of algorithms for finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. 
- Recommendation systems (<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">Amazon item recommendation system</a>) 
    - Predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.    

Notes: 

There are different types of machine learning problems and each type uses different models.

## Supervised learning

<center>
<img src="/module1/supervised-learning.png" height="1000" width="1000"> 
</center>

Notes: 

- Training data comprises a set of observations ($X$) and their corresponding targets ($y$). 
- We wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.
- Then use that model function to predict the labels of new examples.

The example we saw of classifying images is an example of supervised learning:

```{python results='hide'}
from toy_classifier import classify_image

img = Image.open("alpaca.jpg")
img
```

```out

```
<img src="/module1/alpaca.jpg" alt="This image is in /static" width="20%">


Notes: 

The goal of supervised learning is to use	data to find a	model	that outputs the	right	label	based	on the	features.


---

<img src="/module1/alpaca.jpg" alt="This image is in /static" width="20%">

```{python}
classify_image(img, 3)
```

## Unsupervised learning


<center>
<img src="/module1/unsup-learning.png" alt="" height="900" width="900"> 
</center> 

Notes: 

- Training data consists of observations ($X$) without any corresponding targets.
- Unsupervised learning could be used to group similar things together in $X$. 

In unsupervised learning, We have data, but no associated response. We will not be covering unsupervised learning in this course and instead put our main focus on supervised.

Notes: 

There are a number of machine learning libraries available but for this course we will be using the `sklearn` library, which is a popular (41.6k stars on Github) Machine Learning library for Python.

## What we know so far...

- Machine learning is a different paradigm for problem solving.    
    - It lets you solve problems that seem "untractable" or “unprogrammable".
    - It reduces the time you spend programming and helps customizing and scaling your products.     
- In supervised learning we are given a set of observations ($X$) and their corresponding targets ($y$) and we wish to find a model function $f$ that relates $X$ to $y$.
- In unsupervised learning, we are given a set of observations ($X$) and we wish to group similar things together in $X$. 

Notes: 

Here is what we know so far.
