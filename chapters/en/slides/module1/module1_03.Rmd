# Types of machine learning

Notes: <br>

---

Typical learning problems:  

- **Supervised learning (this course)** (<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2368132?hl=en" target="_blank">Gmail spam filtering</a>)
    - Training a model from input data and its corresponding labels to predict new examples.     
- Unsupervised learning (<a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a>)
    - Training a model to find patterns in a dataset, typically an unlabeled dataset.
- Reinforcement learning (<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a>)
    - A family of algorithms for finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. 
- Recommendation systems (<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">Amazon item recommendation system</a>)
    - Predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.    

Notes: 

There are different types of machine learning problems and each type uses different models. 

- **Supervised learning (this course)** (<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2368132?hl=en" target="_blank">Gmail spam filtering</a>) which consists of training a model from input data and its corresponding labels to predict new examples.  

- Unsupervised learning (<a href="https://news.google.com/" target="_blank">Google News</a>) which trains a model to try to find patterns in a dataset, typically without any unlabels.

- Reinforcement learning (<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a>) where a family of algorithms find suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. 

- Recommendation systems (<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">Amazon item recommendation system</a>) which try to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.

## Supervised learning

<center>
<img src="/module1/sup-learning.png" height="1000" width="1000"> 
</center>

Notes: 

- Training data comprises a set of observations (𝑋) and their corresponding targets (𝑦). 
- We wish to find a model function that relates 𝑋 to 𝑦.
- Then, we use that model function to predict the labels of new examples.

```{python results='hide'}
from toy_classifier import classify_image

img = Image.open("alpaca.jpg")
img
```

```out

```
<img src="/module1/alpaca.jpg" alt="This image is in /static" width="20%">


Notes: 

The example we saw of classifying images is an example of supervised learning. 

We give it an image, after training it on data, and have it predict the contents. 


---

<img src="/module1/alpaca.jpg" alt="This image is in /static" width="20%">

```{python}
classify_image(img, 3)
```

Notes: Here, our model is predicting that the animal in the image is a `llama` with 72% probability.

## Unsupervised learning


<center>
<img src="/module1/unsup-learning.png" alt="" height="900" width="900"> 
</center> 

Notes: 

In unsupervised learning, we have training data consisting of observations (𝑋) without any corresponding targets.

Unsupervised learning could be used to group similar things together in 𝑋. 

In unsupervised learning, We have data, but no associated response. 

We will not be covering unsupervised learning in this course and instead, put our main focus on supervised.

Notes: 

There are several machine learning libraries available to use but for this course, we will be using the `sklearn` library, which is a popular (41.6k stars on Github) Machine Learning library for Python.

## What we know so far...

- Machine learning is a different paradigm for problem-solving.    
    - It lets you solve problems that seem "untractable" or “unprogrammable".
    - It reduces the time you spend programming and helps customize and scale your products.  
    
- Machine learning can help either reduce the time humans spend on problem solving or help obtain better results.

- In supervised learning, we are given a set of observations (𝑋) and their corresponding targets 𝑦 and we wish to find a model function that relates 𝑋 to 𝑦.
- In unsupervised learning, we are given a set of observations (𝑋) and we wish to group similar things together in 𝑋. 

Notes: 

Here is what we know so far.
