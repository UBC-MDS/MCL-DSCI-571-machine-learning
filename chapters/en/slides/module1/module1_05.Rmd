# Classification vs Regression 

Notes: <br>

## Classification vs. Regression


- **Classification problem**: predicting among two or more categories, also known as classes
    - *Example1*: Predict whether a patient has a liver disease or not
    - *Example2*: Predict whether the letter grade of a student (A,B,C,D or F)

- **Regression problem**: predicting a continuous (in other words, a number) value
    - Example1: Predict housing prices
    - Example2: Predict a student's score in this course's quiz2.


Notes: 

There are two main kinds of supervised learning problems based on what they are trying to predict; ***Classification*** and  ***Regression***. 

**Classification** predicts a target value among two or more discrete classes. 

For example: 

- whether a patient has a liver disease or not
- whether a student would get an A+ or not in this course's quiz2.

**Regression** predicts a continuous (typically, floating-point) value.

For example: 
- housing prices
- the scores of students in this course's quiz2.

Notes: 

So a classification problem predicts if a student would get an A+ or not and a regression problem predicts the student's actual score of the quiz. 


---

```{python}
classification_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-classification.csv")
classification_df.head()
```


Notes: Here is an example of what the data looks like in classification. Looking at the column `quiz2` which is what we are trying to predict, the possible values are  `A+` or `not A+`.

---

```{python}
regression_df = pd.read_csv("data/quiz2-grade-toy-regression.csv")
regression_df.head()
```



Notes:  As for Regression, the column `quiz2` contains numerical values, like `90` or `82`.
