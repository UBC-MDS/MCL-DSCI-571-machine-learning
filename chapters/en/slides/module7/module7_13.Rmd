# Imbalanced datasets

Notes: <br>

### Class imbalance in training sets

```{python include = FALSE}
cc_df = pd.read_csv('data/creditcard.csv', encoding='latin-1')
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cc_df, test_size=0.3, random_state=222)

X_train_big, y_train_big = train_df.drop(columns=["Class"]), train_df["Class"]
X_test, y_test = test_df.drop(columns=["Class"]), test_df["Class"]

X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_train_big, 
                                                      y_train_big, 
                                                      test_size=0.3, 
                                                      random_state=123)
```



```{python}
X_train.head()
```

```{python}
y_train.value_counts('Class')
```


Notes: 

A class imbalance typically refers to having many more examples of one class than another in one's training set.

We've seen this in our fraud dataset where our `class` target column had many more non-fraud than fraud examples. 

Real-world data is often imbalanced and can be seen in scenarios such as:

- Ad clicking data (Only around ~0.01% of ads are clicked.)
- Spam classification datasets.


---

### Addressing class imbalance

A very important question to ask yourself:     
***"Why do I have a class imbalance?"***

- Is it because one class is much rarer than the other?

- Is it because of my data collection methods?
  
But, if you answer "no" to both of these, it may be fine to just ignore the class imbalance.

Notes: 

A very important question to ask yourself: ***"Why do I have a class imbalance?"***

- Is it because one class is much rarer than the other?
    - If it's just because one is rarer than the other, you need to ask whether you care about False positives or False negatives more than the other.   
- Is it because of my data collection methods?
    - If it's the data collection, then that means _your test and training data come from different distributions_!

But, if you answer "no" to both of these, it may be fine to just ignore the class imbalance.

### Handling imbalance


There are two common approaches to this: 

1. **Changing the training procedure** 

2. **Changing the data (not in this course)**
    - Undersampling
    - Oversampling 




Notes: 

Can we change the model itself so that it considers the errors that are important to us?

There are two common approaches to this: 

1. **Changing the training procedure** 

2. **Changing the data (not in this course)**
    - Undersampling
    - Oversampling

### Changing the training procedure: *class_weight*


<center><img src="/module7/weights-sklearn.png"  width = "80%" alt="404 image" /></center>

    `class_weight: dict or ‘balanced’, default=None`
    
    Set the parameter C of class i to class_weight[i] * C for SVC. 
    If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. 
    The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in 
    the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))




Notes: 

Most `sklearn` classifiers have a parameter called `class_weight`.

This allows you to specify that one class is more important than another.

For example, maybe a false negative is 10x more problematic than a false positive. 

So, if you look for example, in the documentation for the SVM classifier, we see `class_weight` as a parameter.

---

```{python}
tree_default= DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=7)
tree_default.fit(X_train,y_train);
```

```{python}
tree_100 = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=7, class_weight={1:100})
tree_100.fit(X_train,y_train);
```


```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6,  out.width = '78%'}
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.title("Unbalanced")
plot_confusion_matrix(tree_default, X_valid, y_valid, display_labels=["Non fraud", "Fraud"], values_format="d", cmap="Blues", ax=plt.gca());

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("class_weight={1:100}")
plot_confusion_matrix(tree_100, X_valid, y_valid, display_labels=["Non fraud", "Fraud"], values_format="d", cmap="Blues", ax=plt.gca());
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Notes: 
When we made our model before, we can see our confusion matrix on the left.


Now let's rebuild our pipeline but using the `class_weight` argument and setting it as`class_weight={1:100}`. 

This is equivalent to saying "repeat every positive example 200x in the training set", but repeating data would slow down the code, whereas this doesn't.

Notice that we now have reduced false negatives and predicted more Fraud this time.

But, as a consequence, we are also increasing false positives.    


---

## class_weight="balanced"


```{python}
tree_balanced =DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=7, class_weight="balanced")
tree_balanced.fit(X_train,y_train);
```


```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6,  out.width = '80%'}
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.title("Unbalanced")
plot_confusion_matrix(tree_default, X_valid, y_valid, display_labels=["Non fraud", "Fraud"], values_format="d", cmap="Blues", ax=plt.gca());

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("class_weight=balanced")
plot_confusion_matrix(tree_balanced, X_valid, y_valid, display_labels=["Non fraud", "Fraud"], values_format="d", cmap="Blues", ax=plt.gca());
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Notes: 


We can also set `class_weight="balanced"`.

This sets the weights so that the classes are "equal".

We have reduced false negatives but we have many more false positives now! 


---

### Are we doing better with *class_weight="balanced"*?


```{python}
tree_default.score(X_valid, y_valid)
```
```{python}
tree_balanced.score(X_valid, y_valid)
```


Notes: 

Changing the class weight will **generally reduce accuracy**.

The original model was trying to maximize accuracy. Now you're telling it to do something different.

But that's ok since accuracy isn't the only metric that matters.

Let's explain why this happens. 

Since there are so many more negative examples than positive, false positives affect accuracy much more than false negatives.

Thus, precision matters a lot more than recall.

So, the default method trades off a lot of recall for a bit of precision.

### Stratified Splits

<center><img src="/module7/kfolds.png"  width = "840%" alt="404 image" /></center>
 <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html" target="_blank">Attribution: Scikit Learn</a>

Notes: 


A similar idea of "balancing" classes can be applied to data splits.

For example, with cross-validation, there is also <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html" target="_blank">`StratifiedKFold`</a>.

From the documentation it says 

  *"This cross-validation object is a variation of KFold that returns stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class."*


In other words, if we have 10% negative examples in total, then each fold will have 10% negative examples.

 <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.htmll" target="_blank">Attribution:Scikit Learn</a>

Notes: 


We have the same option in `train_test_split` with the `stratify` argument. 

---

### Is stratifying a good idea? 

Yes and no: 

- No longer a random sample.
- It can be especially useful in multi-class situations. 


But in general, these are difficult questions to answer.

Notes: 

Well, it's no longer a random sample, which is probably theoretically bad, but not that big of a deal and If you have many examples, it shouldn't matter as much.

It can be especially useful in multi-class situations, say if you have one class with very few cases.

In general, these are difficult questions to answer.
