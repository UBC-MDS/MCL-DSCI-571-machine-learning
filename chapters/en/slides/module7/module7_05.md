# Precision, recall and f1-score

Notes: <br>

---

## Accuracy is only part of the story…

``` python
pipe_tree = make_pipeline(
    (StandardScaler()),
    (DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=123))
)
```

``` python
pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(pipe_tree, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)).mean()
```

```out
fit_time       6.040506
score_time     0.008705
test_score     0.999119
train_score    1.000000
dtype: float64
```

``` python
y_train.value_counts(normalize=True)
```

```out
0    0.998302
1    0.001698
Name: Class, dtype: float64
```

Notes:

We have been using `.score` to assess our models, which returns accuracy
by default.

Accuracy is misleading when we have a class imbalance.

We need other metrics to assess our models.

We’ll discuss three commonly used metrics which are based on the
confusion matrix:

  - recall
  - precision
  - f1 score

Note that these metrics will only help us assess our model.

Later we’ll talk about a few ways to address the class imbalance
problem.

---

``` python
pipe_tree.fit(X_train,y_train);
predictions = pipe_tree.predict(X_valid)
confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions)
```

```out
array([[59674,    34],
       [   26,    76]])
```

``` python
TN, FP, FN, TP = confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions).ravel()
```

Notes:

Let’s build our pipeline, and fit it. Once we’ve done that, we can
create our confusion matrix.

This time we are going to split up the values in the matrix into the 4
quadrants we saw earlier.

  - `TN` for the True Negatives
  - `FP` for the False Positives
  - `FN` for the False Negatives
  - `TP` for the True Positives

We need each of these values to explain the next measurements.

  - The `.ravel()` function “flattens” or “unravels” the matrix into a
    1D array which makes it easier to obtain the individual values.

### Recall

**Among all positive examples, how many did you identify?**

<img src="/module7/module7_05/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<center>

<img src="/module7/recall.png"  width = "35%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

Notes:

**Recall**: how many of the actual positive examples did you identify?

So, in this case, since fraud is our positive label, we see the
correctly identified labels in the bottom right quadrant and the ones
that we missed in the bottom left quadrant.

---

<center>

<img src="/module7/recall.png"  width = "45%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

``` python
confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions)
```

```out
array([[59674,    34],
       [   26,    76]])
```

``` python
TN, FP, FN, TP = confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions).ravel()
```

``` python
recall = TP / (TP + FN)
recall.round(4)
```

```out
0.7451
```

Notes:

So here we take our true positives and we divide by all the positive
labels in our validation set which is the predictions the model
incorrectly labeled as negative (the false negatives).

---

### Precision

**Among the positive examples you identified, how many were actually
positive?**

<img src="/module7/module7_05/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<center>

<img src="/module7/precision.png"  width = "30%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

Notes:

**Precision**: Of the frauds we “caught”, the fraction that was actually
frauds.

With fraud as our positive label, we see the correctly identified fraud
in the bottom right quadrant and the labels we incorrectly labeled as
frauds in the top right.

---

<center>

<img src="/module7/precision.png"  width = "30%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

``` python
confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions)
```

```out
array([[59674,    34],
       [   26,    76]])
```

``` python
TN, FP, FN, TP = confusion_matrix(y_valid, predictions).ravel()
```

``` python
precision = TP / (TP + FP)
precision.round(4)
```

```out
0.6909
```

Notes:

So here we take our true positives and we divide by all the positive
labels that our model predicted.

Of course, we’d like to have high precision and recall but the balance
depends on our domain.

For credit card fraud detection, recall is really important (catching
frauds), precision is less important (reducing false positives).

---

### f1

**f1-score combines precision and recall to give one score.**

<img src="/module7/module7_05/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<center>

<img src="/module7/f1.png"  width = "35%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

Notes:

**f1**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

**f1-score combines precision and recall to give one score.** which
could be used in hyperparameter optimization, for instance.

---

<center>

<img src="/module7/f1.png"  width = "40%" alt="404 image" />

</center>

``` python
precision
```

```out
0.6909090909090909
```

``` python
recall
```

```out
0.7450980392156863
```

``` python
f1_score = (2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
f1_score
```

```out
0.7169811320754716
```

Notes:

If both precision and recall go up, the f1 score will go up, so in
general, we want this to be high.

Sometimes we need a single score to maximize, e.g., when doing
hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV.

Accuracy is often a bad choice.

## Calculate evaluation metrics by ourselves and with sklearn

``` python
data = {}
data["accuracy"] = [(TP + TN) / (TN + FP + FN + TP)]
data["error"] = [(FP + FN) / (TN + FP + FN + TP)]
data["precision"] = [ TP / (TP + FP)] 
data["recall"] = [TP / (TP + FN)] 
data["f1 score"] = [(2 * precision * recall) / (precision + recall)] 
measures_df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['ourselves'])
```

Notes:

We can calculate all these measurements ourselves using basic math, or…

---

``` python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
```

``` python
pred_cv =  pipe_tree.predict(X_valid) 

data["accuracy"].append(accuracy_score(y_valid, pred_cv))
data["error"].append(1 - accuracy_score(y_valid, pred_cv))
data["precision"].append(precision_score(y_valid, pred_cv, zero_division=1))
data["recall"].append(recall_score(y_valid, pred_cv))
data["f1 score"].append(f1_score(y_valid, pred_cv))

pd.DataFrame(data, index=['ourselves', 'sklearn'])
```

```out
           accuracy     error  precision    recall  f1 score
ourselves  0.998997  0.001003   0.690909  0.745098  0.716981
sklearn    0.998997  0.001003   0.690909  0.745098  0.716981
```

Notes:

…We can use `scikit-learn` which has functions for these metrics.

See
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics" target="_blank">here</a>.

The scores match.

### Classification report

``` python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

``` python
pipe_tree.classes_
```

```out
array([0, 1])
```

``` python
print(classification_report(y_valid, pipe_tree.predict(X_valid),
        target_names=["non-fraud", "fraud"]))
```

```out
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

   non-fraud       1.00      1.00      1.00     59708
       fraud       0.69      0.75      0.72       102

    accuracy                           1.00     59810
   macro avg       0.85      0.87      0.86     59810
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00     59810
```

Notes:

There is a convenient function called `classification_report` in
`sklearn` which gives the information that we described earlier.

We can use `classes` to see which position each label takes so we can
designate them more comprehensive labels in our report.

Note that what you consider “positive” (fraud in our case) is important
when calculating precision, recall, and f1-score.

If you flip what is considered positive or negative, we’ll end up with
different True Positive, False Positive, True Negatives and False
Negatives, and hence different precision, recall, and f1-scores.

The `support` column just shows the number of examples in each class.

Notes:

We’ve provided you with a “Cheat Sheet” that you can refer to.

It will be available
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/introduction-machine-learning/master/static/module7/evaluation-metrics.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

Accuracy is misleading when you have a class imbalance.

A confusion matrix provides a way to break down errors made by our
model.

We have looked at three metrics based on the confusion matrix:

  - precision
  - recall
  - f1-score
