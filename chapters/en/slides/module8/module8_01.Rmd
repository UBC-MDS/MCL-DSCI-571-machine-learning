# Introducing linear regression

Notes: <br>

## Linear Regression

```{python include=FALSE}
np.random.seed(7)
n = 100
X_1 = np.linspace(0,2,n) + np.random.randn(n)*0.01
X = pd.DataFrame(X_1[:,None], columns=['length'])

y = abs(np.random.randn(n,1))*3 + X_1[:,None]*5 + .2
y = pd.DataFrame(y, columns=['weight'])
snakes_df = pd.concat([X,y], axis=1)

train_df, test_df = train_test_split(snakes_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=77)

X_train = train_df[['length']]
y_train = train_df['weight']
X_test = test_df[['length']]
y_test = test_df['weight']
```

```{python}
train_df.head()
```



Notes: 

We've seen many regression models such as `DecisionTreeRegressor` and `KNeighborsRegressor` but now we have a new one that we are going to explore called  
**linear regression**. 

Linear regression is one of the most basic and popular ML/statistical techniques.

Let's bring back the hypothetical snake data that we saw in module 4. 



---

## Ridge

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
LinearRegression();
```


```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
```

```{python}
rm = Ridge()
rm.fit(X_train, y_train);
```

```{python}
rm.predict(X_train)[:5]
```

```{python}
rm.score(X_train, y_train)
```


Notes: 

We can import the `LinearRegression` model like we have for all the previous models we've used  except we are going to instead focus on its close cousin `Ridge`. 

`Ridge` is more flexible than `LinearRegression` and we will explain why shortly. 

When we import `Ridge`, you'll notice that we are importing from the `linear_model` Sklearn library. 

`Ridge`, has the same fit-predict paradigm as the other models we have seen. 

That means we can `fit` on the training set and `predict` a numeric prediction. 


We see that `predict` returns the predicted housing prices for our examples. 

---

## *alpha*

```{python}
rm2 = Ridge(alpha=10000)
rm2.fit(X_train, y_train);
```

```{python}
rm2.score(X_train, y_train)
```



Notes:

Ridge has hyperparameters just like the rest of the models we learned. 

The `alpha` hyperparameter is what makes it more flexible than using `LinearRegression`. 

Remember the fundamental trade-off we spoke about in module 3?

**"As model complexity ↑, training score ↑ and training score– validation score tend to ↑"**

Well, `alpha` controls this fundamental trade-off!

---



```{python }
scores_dict ={
"alpha" :10.0**np.arange(-2,6,1),
"train_scores" : list(),
"cv_scores" : list(),
}
for alpha in scores_dict['alpha']:
    ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
    results = cross_validate(ridge_model, X_train, y_train, return_train_score=True)
    scores_dict['train_scores'].append(results["train_score"].mean())
    scores_dict['cv_scores'].append(results["test_score"].mean())
```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(scores_dict)
```



Notes: 

As we increase `alpha`, we are decreasing our model complexity which means our training score is lower and we are more likely to underfit. 

If we decrease `alpha`, our model complexity is increasing and consequentially our training score is increasing. Our chances of overfitting are going up.

# Visualizing linear regression

```{python include=FALSE}

source = pd.DataFrame(data= {'length':  X_train['length'],
                             'weight':  y_train,
                             'predicted': rm.predict(X_train)})
chart1 = alt.Chart(source, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
x = alt.X('length:Q', title= "Length"), 
y = alt.Y('weight:Q', title= "Weight"))
chart2 = alt.Chart(source, width=500, height=300).mark_line(color= 'orange').encode(
x = alt.X('length:Q', title= "Length"), 
y = alt.Y('predicted:Q', title = "Weight"))

chart3 = (chart1 + chart2).to_json()
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
as_vegaspec(py$chart3)
```


Notes: 

In our data, we only have 1 feature `length` which helps predict our target feature `weight`. 

We can use a 2D graph to plot this and our ridge regression corresponds to a line. 

In this plot, the blue markers are the examples and our orange line is our Ridge regression line. 


If we had an additional feature, let's say, `width`, we now would have 2 features and 1 target so our ridge regression would correspond to a plan in a 3-dimensional space. 

As we increase our features beyond 3 it becomes harder to visualize.
