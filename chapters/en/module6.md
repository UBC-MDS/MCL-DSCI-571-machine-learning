**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

We've seen our basketball dataset but have only used the features `salary`, `weight` and `height`. This time, let's look at the `country` column and transform it. 

Tasks:   
- Import the necessary library.
- Build an ordinal encoder that uses a `dtype` of `int` and name it `ordinal_encoder`. 
- Fit on `X_column`, transform it and save the results in an object named `country_encoded`.

- Are you importing `OrdinalEncoder`?

Last time we ordinal encoded the `country` column from our basketball dataset but now we know that this isn't the best option. This time, instead let's one-hot encode this feature. 

Tasks:    

- Import the necessary library.
- Build a one-hot encoder that uses a `dtype` of `int` and `sparse=True`. Name it `one_hot_encoder`. 
- Fit on `X_column`, transform it and save the results in an object named `country_encoded`.

Let's now start doing transformations and working with them with our basketball dataset. 

We've provided you with the numerical and categorical features, it's your turn to make a pipeline for each and then use `ColumnTransformer` to transform them. 

We have a regression problem this time where we are attempting to predict a player's salary.


Tasks:     
- Import the necessary library.
- Create a pipeline for the numeric features. It should have the first step as simple imputation using `strategy="most_frequent"` and the second step should be using `StandardScaler`.  Name this pipeline `numeric_transformer`.
- Create a pipeline for the categorical features. It should also have 2 steps. The first is imputation using `strategy="median"`. The second step should be one-hot encoding with `handle_unknown="ignore"`. Name this pipeline `categotical_transformer`. 
- Make your column transformer named `col_transformer` and specify the transformations on `numeric_features` and `categorical_features` using the appropriate pipelines you build above. 
-Create a main pipeline named `main_pipe` which preprocesses with `col_transformer` followed by building a `KNeighborsRegressor` model.
- The last step is performing cross-validation using our pipeline.



<codeblock id="06_13">

- Are you importing the right library?
- Are you using `SimpleImputer(strategy="median")` for numerical imputation? 
- Are you naming your steps?
- Are you using `SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")` for categorical imputation?
- Are you using one-hot encoding?
- Are you naming the steps in `ColumnTransformer` and specifying `numeric_transformer` with `numeric_features` and `categorical_transformer` with `categorical_features`?
- Is the first step in your main pipeline calling `col_transformer`?

<exercise id="21" title="Transforming the Fertility Dataset">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

For this question, we will be using a dataset from assignment 1. 

Here is the requested citation:

We will be making pipelines and transforming our features appropriately. 


First, let's take a look at our dataset and the features. 


<codeblock id="fertility">

</codeblock>

Tasks:   
- What are the numeric features? Add them to a list named `numeric_features`.
- What are the binary features? Add them to a list named `binary_features`.
- What are the ordinal features? Add them to a list named `ordinal_features`.
- What are the rest of the categorical features? Add them to a list named `categorical_features`.
- Order the values in `high_fevers_last_year` and name the list `fever_order`. The options are 'more than 3 months ago', 'less than 3 months ago' and 'no'.
- Order the values in `smoking_habit` and name the list `smoking_order`. The options are 'occasional', 'daily' and 'never'.
- Order the values in `freq_alcohol_con` and name the list `alcohol_order`. The options are 'once a week', 'hardly ever or never', 'several times a week', 'several times a day' and 'every day'.
- There are several pipelines already made for you. Designate `numeric_transformer` to the numerical transformer, `categorical_transformer` to the transformer that is not transforming binary or ordinal features, `binary_transformer` to the transformer of binary features, and `ordinal_transformer1`, `ordinal_transformer2` and `ordinal_transformer3` to the transformer of columns `high_fevers_last_year`, `smoking_habit` and `freq_alcohol_con` respectively. 
- Fill in the associated gaps in the column transformer named `preprocessor`. 
- Build a main pipeline using `KNeighborsClassifier` and name the object `main_pipe`.
- Cross-validate and see the results.

- Are you ordering the ordinal values correctly? 
- Do you have 3 binary features?
- Are you naming the pipelines correctly?

**Question 1**   
What is the size of the vocabulary for the examples below?

    "Drop me in the water.",
    "Push me in the river,",
    " dip me in the water"]

Great! The model is becoming more complex.

Increasing the value of `max_features` means we include each and every word from the training data in the dictionary and the training score is likely to go up.

<exercise id="25" title="CountVectorizer with Disaster Tweets">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

We are going to bring in a new dataset for you to practice on. 

This dataset contains a text column containing tweets associated with disaster keywords and a target column denoting whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0). (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vstepanenko/disaster-tweets" target="_blank"><b>Source</b></a>)

In this question, we are going to explore how changing the value of `max_features` affects our training and cross-validation scores.

Tasks:

- Import `CountVectorizer`.
- Split the dataset into the feature table `X` and the target value `y`. `X` will be the single column `text` from the dataset wheras `target` will be your `y`. 
- Split your data into your training and testing data using a text size of 20% and a random state of 7. 
- Make a pipeline with `CountVectorizer` as the first step and `KNeighborsClassifier` as the second. Name the pipeline `pipe`. 
- Perform RandomizedSearchCV using the parameters specified in `param_grid` and name the search `tweet_search`.
- Don't forget to fit your grid search.
- What is the best max_features value? Save it in an object name `tweet_feats`.
- What is the best score? Save it in an object named `tweet_val_score`.
- Score the optimal model on the test set and save it in an object named `tweet_test_score`.

<codeblock id="06_25">

- Are you splitting using `train_test_split()`
- Are you using `make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), KNeighborsClassifier())`?
- Are you using `RandomizedSearchCV()` and calling `pipe` and `param_grid` as the first 2 arguments?
- Are you naming the randomized grid search `tweet_search`?
- Are you fitting `tweet_search`?
- Are you using `tweet_search.best_params_['countvectorizer__max_features']` to get the optimal number of features?
- Are you using `tweet_search.best_score_` to get the best validation score?
- Are you using `tweet_search.score(X_test, y_test)` to get the test score?
