**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**
hi tes

_Diagnosing cancer from Magnetic resonance imaging_

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True"  correct="true">

Great 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

Machine Learning can be use to attempt to diagnose cancer.

</opt>

</choice>

**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**

_Classifying images containing animals_

<choice id="2">
<opt text="True" correct="true">

Nice work! 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

If you look at example 2, in the slides you'll see the code we used to do this. 

</opt>

</choice >

**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**   
_Blowing out a candle_

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="True" >

No quite sure how this would work, but never say never! Technology is progressing everyday. 

</opt>

<opt text="I don't think we can use machine learning quite yet to " correct= "true">

Maybe one day we will be able to! Who knows.

<exercise id="4" title=" Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

**Given the following scenarios, would each example be considered supervised learning or unsupervised learning?**

**Example:**   
_Finding groups of similar properties in a real estate data set._

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Is there a "true number" of groups of similar properties? Are the groups known and defined?

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Good job! This is an unsupervised learning example.

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**    
_predicting real estate prices based on house features (number of rooms,past sales, etc.)_

<choice id="2">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work! Since we have examples with known value of real estate prices, we can use this predict real estate prices for homes we don't know the price on. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning">

Do we have true corresponding values of what we are predicting with?

</opt>

</choice >

**Example:**   
_Detecting credit card fraud based on examples of fraudulent transactions._

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct= "true">

Great! Since we have examples with labels of "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent", we can detect if transactions with similar features to our examples are of the same nature. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

Do we have examples of the true corresponding value of what we are predicting?

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**   
_Idenitfying groups of animals given features such as "number of legs", "wings/no wings", "fur/no fur", etc._

<choice  id="4">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work.

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

We know what the animal is suppose to be classfied as and we are hoping that with the given features, the model will be able to classify the animal.


</opt>
</choice>

**Example:**   
_Grouping articles on different topics from different news sources (something like Google News app)._


<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Here we do not have a clear "correct" answer and therefor this is an example of unsupervised learning. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning"  correct= "true">

Grouping is also called *clustering* which is an example of unsupervised learning.

<exercise id="6" title="Classification vs. Regression">


**Example:**  
_Predicting the price of a house based on features  such as  number of roomsand the year built._

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Classification">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value and therefore this is an example of regression.

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting if a house will sell or not based on features like the price of the house, number of rooms, etc._

<choice  id="2">
<opt text="Classification" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Sell/Not Sell) and therefore this is an example of classification.

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" >

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting your grade in this course based on your grade in Programming in Python for Data Science._

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Classification">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value (percent grade) and therefore this is an example of regression.

</opt>
</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting whether you should bicycle to work tomorrow based on the weather forecast._

<choice  id="4">
<opt text="Classification" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Bike/Not bike) and therefore this is an example of classification.

</opt>

<opt text="Regression">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

<exercise id="10" title="Describing a Dataset">

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a Dataset for machine learning. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 

- Print the `canbybar_df` object. 
- Save the dimensions of the dataframe in an object named `candybar_dim`.

<codeblock id="01_10">

- Are you using `.shape` to find the dimensions? 

</codeblock>

**Question:**  
How many features does the data have?

<choice  id="1">
<opt text="9">

This is the total number of columns, not the number of features

</opt>

<opt text="8" correct="true">

Yes! Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="25">

This is not the number of features.

</opt>

<opt text="10">

We don't include the index or the target as a feature.

</opt>
</choice>

**Question:**   
 How many examples does the data have?

<choice  id="2">

<opt text="9">

This is the total number of columns, not the number of examples.

**Do the following statements correspond to the `fit` or the `predict` function:**  

**Statement:**   
_Is called first (before the other one)._

<choice id="1">

Great job! Training on training data must be done before predicting on new data. 

</opt>

<opt text="Predict" >

How can the model predict without education first?

</opt>
</choice>

**Statement:**  
_At least for decision trees, this is where most of the hard work is done._

Great job! Training is more intensive then predicting for decision trees. 

</opt>

<opt text="Predict" >

Where do we teach the model? 

</opt>
</choice>

**Statement:**   
_Only takes `X` as an argument._
