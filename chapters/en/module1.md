**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**

_Diagnosing cancer from Magnetic resonance imaging_

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True"  correct="true">

Great 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

Machine Learning can be use to attempt to diagnose cancer.

</opt>

</choice>

**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**

_Classifying images containing animals_

<choice id="2">
<opt text="True" correct="true">

Nice work! 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

If you look at example 2, in the slides you'll see the code we used to do this. 

</opt>

</choice >

**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**   
_Blowing out a candle_

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="True" >

No quite sure how this would work, but never say never! Technology is progressing everyday. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct= "true">

I don't think we can use machine learning quite yet to. Maybe one day we will be able to! Who knows.

<exercise id="4" title=" Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

**Given the following scenarios, would each example be considered supervised learning or unsupervised learning?**

**Example:**   
_Finding groups of similar properties in a real estate data set._

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Is there a "true number" of groups of similar properties? Are the groups known and defined?

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Good job! This is an unsupervised learning example.

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**    
_Predicting real estate prices based on house features (number of rooms,past sales, etc.)._

<choice id="2">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work! Since we have examples with known value of real estate prices, we can use this predict real estate prices for homes we don't know the price on. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning">

Do we have true corresponding values of what we are predicting with?

</opt>

</choice >

**Example:**   
_Detecting credit card fraud based on examples of fraudulent transactions._

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct= "true">

Great! Since we have examples with labels of "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent", we can detect if transactions with similar features to our examples are of the same nature. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

Do we have examples of the true corresponding value of what we are predicting?

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**   
_Identifying groups of animals given features such as "number of legs", "wings/no wings", "fur/no fur", etc._

<choice  id="4">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work.

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

We know what the animal is suppose to be classified as and we are hoping that with the given features, the model will be able to classify the animal.


</opt>
</choice>

**Example:**   
_Grouping articles on different topics from different news sources (something like Google News app)._


<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Here we do not have a clear "correct" answer and therefor this is an example of unsupervised learning. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning"  correct= "true">

Grouping is also called *clustering* which is an example of unsupervised learning.

Is the prediction a categorical or a numerical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value and therefore this is an example of regression.

</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting if a house will sell or not based on features like the price of the house, number of rooms, etc._

<choice  id="2">
<opt text="Classification" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Sell/Not Sell) and therefore this is an example of classification.

**Example:**  
_Predicting your grade in this course based on your grade in Programming in Python for Data Science._

Is the prediction a categorical or a numerical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value (percent grade) and therefore this is an example of regression.

**Example:**  
_Predicting whether you should bicycle to work tomorrow based on the weather forecast._

<exercise id="11" title="Describing a Dataset">

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a Dataset for machine learning. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 

- Print the `canbybar_df` object. 
- Save the dimensions of the dataframe in an object named `candybar_dim`.

<codeblock id="01_11">

- Are you using `.shape` to find the dimensions?

<exercise id="12" title="Separating Our Data">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's split up our the data in the candybars dataframe into our features and target. 
For this dataframe the features are the columns `chocolate` to `multi` and the target is the column `availability`.

Tasks:     

- Save the columns `chocolate` to `multi` in an object named `X`
- Since we are attempting to predict the country availability of candy bars, make the column `availability` the target and name the object `y`. 



<codeblock id="01_12">

- Are you using `.loc[]` to obtain the columns `chocolate` to `multi`?
- Are you select the column `availability` with single brackets?

**Statement:**  
_At least for decision trees, this is where most of the hard work is done._

Let's build a baseline model by using the `DummyClassifier()` function. 

Tasks:     

- Build a baseline model using the `DummyClassifier()` function and `uniform` for the `strategy` argument. Save this in an object named `model`. 
- fit your model and then predict on the target column. 
- What is the accuracy of the model to 2 decimal places? Save this in the object `accuracy`.

<codeblock id="01_16">

- Make sure you are using the correct functions.
- Are you using the model named `model`?
- Are you calling `.fit(X,y)` on your model?
- Are you using `model.score(X,y)` to find the accuracy?
