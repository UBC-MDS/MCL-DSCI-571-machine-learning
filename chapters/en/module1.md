<exercise id="2" title=" Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

**Given the following scenarios, would each example be considered supervised learning or unsupervised learning?**

**Example:**   
_Finding groups of similar properties in a real estate data set._

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Is there a "true number" of groups of similar properties? Are the groups known and defined?

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Good job! This is an unsupervised learning example.

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**    
_Is predicting real estate prices based on house features (number of rooms, learning from past sales, etc.) learning from past sales as examples supervised learning or unsupervised learning?_

<choice id="2">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work! Since we have examples with known value of real estate prices, we can use this predict real estate prices for homes we don't know the price on. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning">

Do we have true corresponding values of what we are predicting with?

</opt>

</choice >

**Example:**   
_Detecting credit card fraud based on examples of fraudulent transactions_

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct= "true">

Great! Since we have examples with labels of "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent", we can detect if transactions with similar features to our examples are of the same nature. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

Do we have examples of the true corresponding value of what we are predicting?

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**   
_Idenitfying groups of animals given features such as "number of legs", "wings/no wings", "fur/no fur", etc._

<choice  id="4">
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Not quite! Do we have predefined know groups that we are classifying?

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Since we are clustering animals that are similar and there are no pre-defined groups, this is an example of unsupervised learning.

<exercise id="4" title="Classification vs. Regression">

**Given the following scenarios, would each example be considered classification or regression?**


**Example:**  
_Predicting the price of a house based on features like number of rooms_

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Classification">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value and therefore this is an example of regression.

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting if a house will sell or not based on features like the price of the house, number of rooms, etc._

<choice  id="2">
<opt text="Classification" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Sell/Not Sell) and therefore this is an example of classification.

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" >

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting your grade in 571 based on past grades._

<choice  id="3">
<opt text="Classification">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

</opt>

<opt text="Regression" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a numerical value (percent grade) and therefore this is an example of regression.

</opt>
</choice>

**Example:**  
_Predicting whether you should bicycle to work tomorrow based on the weather forecast._

<choice  id="4">
<opt text="Classification" correct="true">

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Bike/Not bike) and therefore this is an example of classification.

<opt text="Regression">

Is the prediction a categorical or a numical value?

<exercise id="8" title="Describing a Dataset">

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a Dataset for machine learning. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 

- Print the `canbybar_df` object. 
- Save the feature names as a list named `candybar_feat`.
- Save the candybar names in a list named `candybar_names`.
- Save the dimensions of the dataframe as a tuple named `candybar_dim`.

<codeblock id="01_08">

- Are you sure you are saving `candybar_feat` and `candybar_names` as lists?
- Did you import the csv with the correct manner?

</codeblock>

**Question:**  
How many features does the data have?

<choice  id="1">
<opt text="9">

This is the total number of columns, not the number of features

</opt>

<opt text="8" correct="true">

Yes! Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="25">

This is not the number of features.

</opt>

<opt text="6">

**Question:**   
 How many examples does the data have?

**Do the following statements correspond to the `fit` or the `predict` function:**  

**Statement:**   
_Is called first (before the other one)._

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Fit" correct="true">

Great job! Training on training data must be done before predicting on new data. 

</opt>

<opt text="Predict" >

How can the model predict without education first?

</opt>
</choice>

**Statement:**  
_At least for decision trees, this is where most of the hard work is done._

<choice id="2">
<opt text="Fit" correct="true">

Great job! Training is more intensive then predicting for decision trees. 

</opt>

<opt text="Predict" >

Where do we teach the model? 

</opt>
</choice>

**Statement:**   
_Only takes `X` as an argument._

<choice id="3">

<exercise id="11" title="Building Your Model">

Let's try training and prediction our own model. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

<exercise id="13" title="Calculating Gini Impurity">

Let's try calculating the Gini impurity  on our candybar dataset using the same `gini2` function from the module slides. The function has been imported for you. 

Let's make the split on the feature `peanuts` where anything greater than 0.5 is classified as `American`. Remember that you now have 2 groups and you need to calculate the impurity for both groups.  

* Don't forget to take into consideration the porportion of observations in each group!

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 
Save your Gini impurity as object `peanut_gini_impurity`

<codeblock id="01_13">

- Are you taking into consideration there are 2 gini calculations ( you will have to call `gini2 ` twice)?
- There are 6 observations of the 16 that have `peanuts` >= 0.5. Of those, 5 are of class `America` and 1 is of class `Canada`. 
- There are 10 observations of the 16 that have `peanuts` < 0.5. Of, those 3 are of class `America` and 7 is of class `Canada`.

**Question:**   
What type of tree are Decision Trees?

<choice id="1">
<opt text= "General Tree" >
 
How are the features split ?

<exercise id="17" title= "Decision Stumps">

**Question:**   
What is the depth of a decision stump? 

<choice id="1">
<opt text= "1" correct="true">
 
You have been paying attention! Nice work! 

</opt>

<opt text="5" >

This is the default max depth of the decision tree classifier not the depth of a decision stump.

<opt text="Whatever you set it as" >

Decision stumps are what make up a decision tree, stumps are not a hyperparameter

<exercise id="18" title= "Decision Tree True and False">

**Are the following Statements True or False**:

**Statement**    
_The standard decision tree algorithm finds the optimal tree given a data set._

<choice id="1">
<opt text= "True" >
 
For each node the model finds the optimal feature to split on but the nodes are chosen sequentially and it cannot choose the overall optimal tree. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Great! Just because the model chooses the best feature to split on each node does not mean the total tree is the optimal one! 

</opt>

</choice>

**Statement:**     
_The same feature can be split on multiple times in a tree with depth > 1._

<choice id="2">
<opt text= "True" correct="true">
 
Super! There can be multiple threshold splits used for the same feature.

<opt text="False" >

There can be multiple threshold splits used for the same feature.
