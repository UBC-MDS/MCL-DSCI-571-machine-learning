<exercise id="4" title="Splitting Data in Action">

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's split our data using `train_test_split()` on our candy bars dataset.

Tasks:     

- Split the `X` and `y` dataframes into 4 objects: `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`. 
- Make the test set 0.2 (or the train set 0.8) and make sure to use `random_state=7`. 
- Build a model using `DecisionTreeClassifier()`. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X_train` and `y_train`.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model using `.score()` on `X_train` and `y_train` save the values in an object named `train_score`.
- Repeat the above action but this time evaluate the accuracy of the model using `.score()` on `X_test` and `y_test` (which the model has never seen before) and save the values in an object named `test_score`. 

<codeblock id="03_04">

- Are you using `X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=7)`?

**Question 1**   
We carry out cross-validation to avoid reusing the same validation set again and again. With ùëò -fold cross-validation, you split your ùëõ examples into ùëò folds. For each fold, how many examples do you train on? 

<choice id="1">

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="ùëõ"  >

This is the number of examples. We would get a very low score if we divided by this.

**True or False**

_The goal of cross-validation is to obtain a better estimate of test error than just using a single validation set._

<choice id="2">
<opt text="True" >

The goal of cross-validation is to train on more examples while still tuning your hyperparameters.

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Nailed it!

**True or False**

_The main disadvantage of using a large $k$ in cross-validation is running time._

<choice id="3">

Nailed it!

</opt>

<opt text="False" >

Since we need to train multiple times and predict multiple times, it can be very time-consuming.

**True or False**

_2-fold cross-validation is the same thing as using a validation set that's 50% the size of your training set._
