**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**

_Diagnosing cancer from Magnetic resonance imaging_

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True"  correct="true">

Great 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

Machine Learning can be use to attempt to diagnose cancer.

**True or False: The following is an example of machine learning?**

_Classifying images containing animals_

<choice id="2">
<opt text="True" correct="true">

Nice work! 

</opt>

<opt text="False">

If you look at example 2, in the slides you'll see the code we used to do this.

No quite sure how this would work, but never say never! Technology is progressing everyday. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct= "true">

I don't think we can use machine learning quite yet to. Maybe one day we will be able to! Who knows.
