<exercise id="3" title="Scenario 2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

Is predicting real estate prices based on house features (number of rooms, learning from past sales, etc.) learning from past sales as examples supervised learning or unsupervised learning?

<choice>
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work! Since we have examples with known value of real estate prices, we can use this predict real estate prices for homes we don't know the price on.

<exercise id="13" title="Describing a Dataset">

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a Dataset for machine learning. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 

- Print the `canbybar_df` object. 
- Save the feature names as a list named `candybar_feat`.
- Save the candybar names in a list named `candybar_names`.
- Save the dimensions of the dataframe as a tuple named `candybar_dim`.

<codeblock id="01_13">

- Are you sure you are saving `candybar_feat` and `candybar_names` as lists?
- Did you import the csv with the correct manner?

</codeblock>

<exercise id="23" title="Calculating Gini Impurity">

Let's try calculating the Gini impurity  on our candybar dataset using the same `gini2` function from the module slides. The function has been imported for you. 

Let's make the split on the feature `peanuts` where anything greater than 0.5 is classified as `American`. Remember that you now have 2 groups and you need to calculate the impurity for both groups.  

* Don't forget to take into consideration the porportion of observations in each group!

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 
Save your Gini impurity as object `peanut_gini_impurity`

<codeblock id="01_23">

- Are you taking into consideration there are 2 gini calculations ( you will have to call `gini2 ` twice)?
- There are 6 observations of the 16 that have `peanuts` >= 0.5. Of those, 5 are of class `America` and 1 is of class `Canada`. 
- There are 10 observations of the 16 that have `peanuts` < 0.5. Of, those 3 are of class `America` and 7 is of class `Canada`.

What type of tree are Decision Trees?

<choice>
<opt text= "General Tree" >
 
How are the features split ?  

</opt>

<opt text="Binary Trees (2 children per node)." correct="true">

Nice work!

<exercise id="26" title="Summary Decision Tree Question 2">

Who choses the features that are split on at each node?

<choice>
<opt text= "Data Scientist" >
 
Where would we input this information?  

</opt>

<opt text="Model" correct="true">

Great!

<exercise id="27" title="Summary Decision Tree Question 3">

What is the depth of a decision stump? 

<choice>
<opt text= "1" correct="true">
 
You have been paying attention! Nice work! 

</opt>

<opt text="5" >

This is the default max depth of the decision tree classifier not the depth of a decision stump.

</opt>

<opt text="Whatever you set it as" >

Decision stumps are what make up a decision tree, stumps are not a hyperparameter

</opt>
</choice>
</exercise>

<exercise id="28" title="Summary Decision Tree Question 4">

Is the following Statement ***True*** or ***False***:

_The standard decision tree algorithm finds the optimal tree given a data set._

<choice>
<opt text= "True" >
 
For each node the model finds the optimal feature to split on but the nodes are chosen sequentially and it cannot choose the overall optimal tree. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Great! Just because the model chooses the best feature to split on each node does not mean the total tree is the optimal one! 

</opt>

</choice>

<exercise id="29" title="Summary Decision Tree Question 5">

Is the following Statement ***True*** or ***False***:

_The same feature can be split on multiple times in a tree with depth > 1._
