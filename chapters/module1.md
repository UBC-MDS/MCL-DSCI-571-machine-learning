<exercise id="2" title="Scenario 1: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

Is finding groups of similar properties in a real estate data set an example of supervised learning or unsupervised learning?

<choice>
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Is there a "true number" of groups of similar properties? Are the groups known and defined?

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Good job! This is an unsupervised learning example.

</opt>

</choice>

</exercise>

<exercise id="3" title="Scenario 2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

Is predicting real estate prices based on house features (number of rooms, learning from past sales, etc.) learning from past sales as examples supervised learning or unsupervised learning?

<choice>
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct="true">

Nice work! Since we have examples with known value of real estate prices, we can use this predict real estate prices for homes we don't know the price on. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning">

Do we have true corresponding values of what we are predicting with?

</opt>

</choice>

<exercise id="4" title="Scenario 3: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

Is detecting credit card fraud based on examples of fraudulent transactions an example supervised learning or unsupervised learning?

<choice>
<opt text="Supervised Learning" correct= "true">

Great! Since we have examples with labels of "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent", we can detect if transactions with similar features to our examples are of the same nature. 

</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" >

Do we have examples of the true corresponding value of what we are predicting?

</opt>

</choice>

<exercise id="4" title="Scenario 4: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning">

Is identifying groups of animals given features such as "number of legs", "wings/no wings", "fur/no fur", etc. an example supervised learning or unsupervised learning?

<choice>
<opt text="Supervised Learning">

Not quite! Do we have predefined know groups that we are classifying?
</opt>

<opt text="Unsupervised Learning" correct="true">

Since we are clustering animals that are similar and there are no pre-defined groups, this is an example of unsupervised learning.

Good job! We are predicting a categorical value (Sell/Not Sell) and therefore this is an example of classification.

<exercise id="13" title="Describing a Dataset">

Let's make sure we understand all the components we use in a Dataset for machine learning. 

**Instructions:**

When you run a code exercise for the first time, it could take a bit of time for everything to load. 

**When you see `____` in a code exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run it and see if it you obtain the desired output. Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

The packages you need will be loaded for you. 

- Print the `canbybar_df` object. 
- Save the feature names as a list named `candybar_feat`.
- Save the candybar names in a list named `candybar_names`.
- Save the dimensions of the dataframe as a tuple named `candybar_dim`.

<codeblock id="01_13">

- Are you sure you are saving `candybar_feat` and `candybar_names` as lists?
- Did you import the csv with the correct manner?

</codeblock>

Question: How many features does the data have?

<choice>
<opt text="9">

This is the total number of columns, not the number of features

</opt>

<opt text="8" correct="true">

Yes! Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="25">

This is not the number of features.

<choice>
<opt text="Fit" correct="true">

Great job! Training is more intensive then predicting for decision trees.

Does this statement correspond to the `fit` or the `predict` function:   

_Only takes `X` as an argument._
